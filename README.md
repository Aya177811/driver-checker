# driver-checker
1- Create a script named "driver-checker" that can be run from anywhere (hint: /bin)

2- the script takes 1 argument that must be (new OR get OR list)

3- if the argument is "new", then show a menu to the user asking for their name / age / vision_rate (1-6)

4- print a message telling the user they are OR are not eligible for a driver's license based on their age and vision_rate (age should be 18 and more & vision_rate should be 4 and more in order to be eligible)

5- redirect the result to a log file in this format [name:age:vision_rate:result] example (ahmed:27:5:eligible)

6- if the argument is "get", then show a menu to the user asking for the name of the user that they want to see their result

7- print a message showing the result of that specific user in this format [name:result] example (ahmed:eligible)

8- if the argument is "list", then print a message showing the result of all users in this format [name:result] example
